{"name":"EGSnrc","tagline":"Toolkit for Monte Carlo simulation of ionizing radiation transport","body":"## Documentation\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is EGSnrc?\r\n\r\nEGSnrc is a software toolkit to perform Monte Carlo simulation of\r\nionizing radiation transport through matter. It models the propagation\r\nof photons, electrons and positrons with kinetic energies between\r\n1&nbsp;keV and 10&nbsp;GeV, in homogeneous materials. EGSnrc is an\r\nextended and improved version of the Electron Gamma Shower (EGS)\r\nsoftware package originally developed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator\r\nCenter (SLAC) in the 1970s. Most notably, it incorporates significant\r\nrefinements in charged particle transport, better low energy cross\r\nsections, and the egs++ class library to model elaborate geometries and\r\nparticle sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nEGSnrc is distributed as free software under the terms of the GNU Affero\r\nGeneral Public Licence. Please review the [LICENSE](LICENCE.md) document\r\nbefore downloading the software. In practice, this licence imposes no\r\nrestriction on using EGSnrc. However, if you want to further convey\r\nverbatim or modified versions of the code, or any work based on any\r\nEGSnrc component (including any such work operated remotely over a\r\nnetwork), you must do so under the same licence terms. [Contact NRC]\r\n(http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/egsnrc_index.html)\r\nif you wish to licence EGSnrc under different terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nEGSnrc can be installed on computers running Linux, OS X or Windows\r\noperating systems. As a general-purpose Monte Carlo toolkit, EGSnrc\r\nprovides source code and utilities to build and run your own\r\nradiation transport simulation applications. To use EGSnrc\r\non any platform you need:\r\n\r\n- a Fortran compiler\r\n- a C compiler\r\n- a C++ compiler\r\n- the GNU `make` utility\r\n- the Tcl/Tk interpreter and widget toolkit\r\n- the Grace plotting tool\r\n\r\nPlease read the [installation instructions]\r\n(https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/wiki/Installation-overview) in the\r\nwiki for more details about these software components.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstallation involves downloading the EGSnrc source code, and then\r\nconfiguring EGSnrc for your computer. We recommend using the `git`\r\nrevision control software to obtain the source code. The following shell\r\ncommand will clone the EGSnrc repository to your current working\r\ndirectory:\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc.git\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, you can download a [zip archive]\r\n(https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/archive/master.zip) of the EGSnrc\r\ndirectory. Once you have downloaded the source code, you need to run a\r\nconfiguration GUI or script to set up and compile EGSnrc software\r\ncomponents for your computer. Please read the full [installation\r\ninstructions]\r\n(https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/wiki/Installation-overview) for more\r\ndetails on how to download and configure EGSnrc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\nUse the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/issues) to\r\nreport bugs, inaccuracies or even small typos in the EGSnrc project\r\nfiles. The tracker lets you browse and search all documented issues,\r\ncomment on open issues, and track their progress. Note that the issue\r\ntracker is **not meant for technical support;** open an issue only if it\r\npertains to an error condition which is precise and reproducible.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nYou can contribute to the EGSnrc project by implementing new features,\r\ncreating new data sets, correcting errors, or improving documentation.\r\nFeel free to submit small corrections and contributions as issues in the\r\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/issues). For more\r\nextensive contributions, familiarize yourself with git and github,\r\nwork on your own EGSnrc project fork and submit your changes via a pull\r\nrequest. Note that significant contributions will require a transfer of\r\ncopyright to the National Research Council of Canada before they can be\r\nmerged into the EGSnrc distribution.\r\n","google":"UA-70777104-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
